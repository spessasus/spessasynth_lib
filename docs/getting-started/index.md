# Getting Started with spessasynth_lib
!!! TIP

## spessasynth_lib vs spessasynth_core
There are two similar libraries: `spessasynth_lib` and `spessasynth_core`:

- core is the main library that contains all MIDI, SF2,DLS parsing and synthesis engine. It can run in any JS environment.
- lib builds on top of core,
relying on the WebAudioAPI to add an easy-to-use wrapper and brings default effect processors along.
It is dependent on core, so all writing and conversion features can be used directly from core.

So:

### Use spessasynth_lib if:
- You want to play MIDI files in the browser without much work.
- You don't want to have to program your own audio processor.
- The default effects are good enough for you.
- You don't need direct access to the audio engine.

### Use spessasynth_core if:
- You want [direct audio engine access](main-thread-rendering.md).
- You want custom effect processors.
- You need full control over the audio.
- You don't have access to the WebAudioAPI.


!!! Tip

    Note that `spessasynth_core` is a dependency of `spessasynth_lib`, so all writing functions and properties are still available!

## Installation
```shell
npm install --save spessasynth_lib
```

## Minimal setup
The minimal working setup requires [`WorkletSynthesizer` class](../synthesizer/basic-synthesizer.md) and [adding the worklet module](../synthesizer/importing-the-worklet.md).

The setup is initialized as follows:
```js
audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule("path/to/worklet");
const synth = new WorkletSynthesizer(context);
```
Make sure to replace `/path/to/worklet/` with one of the paths described [here](../synthesizer/importing-the-worklet.md).

That's it! Now you can move onto learning how a  [simple MIDI player](simple-example.md) works.


!!! Warning

    This wiki only describes the WebAudio API wrappers that spesasynth_lib itself provides.
    Most of the types (such as `BasicMIDI`, `BasicSoundbank` and more) are documented in [spessasynth_core documentation](https://spessasus.github.io/spessasynth_core/).
    
    If what you're looking for isn't in this wiki, it's probably there.
